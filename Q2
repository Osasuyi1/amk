Let x and y be number of wrong and right answers respectively
Given 20 questions, then 
x + y = 20    
x = 20 - y    --equation 1
Given total score of 125, then
10x + 5y = 125 --equation 2
Substitute for x in the equation 2 
10(20-y) + 5y = 125
200 - 10y + 5y = 125
200 - 5y = 125
making y subject of formulra gives
y = (200 - 125)/5
y = 15
Substitute for y in equation 1 to find x
x = 20 - 15
x = 5
Number of wrong answer is 5.
