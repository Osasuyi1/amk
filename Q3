Database Indexes are structures, associated with tables and clusters, which allow SQL
queries to execute more quickly. An Oracle Database index provides a faster access path to
table data. We can use indexes without rewriting any queries. The results are the same, but
returns them more quickly.
Indexes can be created automatically(PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE KEY creation) or manually (CREATE INDEX or CREATE TABLE statement).
